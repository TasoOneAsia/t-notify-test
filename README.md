# T-Notify Testing Resource

This resource is meant to serve as a general example as well as a compatibility tester 
for the T-Notify FiveM resource, which can be found [here](https://github.com/TasoOneAsia/t-notify).

It features a small set of commands (both client/server) for testing most of T-Notify's features.

## Commands

### Client
```bash
# For main client testing
/client:test
# For client validation testing
/client:validation
# For client testing starting a persistent noti
/client:persist:start
/client:persist:start2
# For client testing ending a persistent noti
/client:persist:end
/client:persist:end2
```

### Server
```bash
# For main server testing
/server:test
# For server testing starting a persistent noti
/server:persist:start
/server:persist:start2
# For server testing ending a persistent noti

/server:persist:end2
```
